Hitman 2 is a stealth video game developed by IO Interactive and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is the seventh major installment in the Hitman video game series and is the sequel to the 2016 game Hitman. Hitman 2 is a game where it requires quick thinking and fast reflexes in order to stay hidden and not get caught by the bad guys. <br><br>

<b>Story:</b> <br>
I didn’t really like the story, I even forgot there was one to begin with, it starts out with the main character who’s name is unknown and they just call him Agent 47. In the game, you have a friend that remembers everything that happened to you when you were younger. In the first Hitman they had smooth cutscenes with animations and it looked like a live movie. But in Hitman 2 the cutscenes look more like something out of a comic, no animation at all, not as clean as the older cutscenes, but what is more important is the gameplay, which is what we will get into right now. <br><br>

<b>Gameplay:</b> <br>
Personally, I thought the gameplay in Hitman 2 was awesome, the thrill of people trying to catch you and then you quickly jumping into a closet behind, or changing your disguise never gets old. I will say though sometimes I got annoyed that Agent 47 couldn’t run at all and if you were getting shot at all you could do was hope that somehow Agent 47 would walk and somehow survive. I will say all the different options of equipment you can use though makes the game very replayable, there are many different ways to complete a level, for example, if you happen to overhear people talking about one of your targets, you will unlock a “Story Mission” and be able to gather information on one creative way to kill your targets. One of my favorite tech was coins, which I would throw which would get people’s attention and then I could lure them away from the others and subdue them without anyone realizing. All of these different solutions to one problem makes Hitman 2 a very replayable game. <br><br>

<b>Verdict:</b> <br>
As I said before, Hitman 2 is a very replayable game, but the price of Hitman 2 is way too high and personally I wouldn’t get it unless it was on sale and was way cheaper than its original price. If you want to get the full experience you have to pay way over $100 out of your pocket, this might be ok if there was even more gameplay the average for completing this game is 8 hours, if you buy all the DLC like I did, it might take you around 16-18 hours, while Red Dead Redemption 2 I played for 60 hours, and it was $60, nothing close to the asking price for Hitman 2. All in all I wish there was more gameplay because the price tag is so high, I wish they put more effort in making the gameplay different than what it was from Hitman 2016 and it would have been nice if the cutscenes were a bit smoother, but the latter isn’t as important as the other things I said. These are changes I’m hoping they will make in the future for the upcoming game Hitman 3. <br><br>
